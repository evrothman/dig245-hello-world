    <h1> Hello Everyone! </h1>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>My Name is Evan Rothman, I am a senior Philosophy, Politcs,
            and Economics Major </li>
        <li>I am working towards a minor in digital media studies and am
            generally interested in web design </li>
        <li>I have very little programing experience beyond taking a web design
            course early in high school. I have tinkered with wix, weebly, and
            wordpress in the past but overal have very little experience with
            content creation </li>
        <li>I would like to gain a cursoury understanding of backend design as
            well as how to build a strong user interface
        <li>I worked through the "keyboard shortcuts & workflows" section and
        found that while some of the keyboard shortcuts were helpful, others
        either didn't work on windows or took me longer to execute that doing
        it how I normally would. As an example, control +tab simply changed the
        tab I was in rather than switching to a text editor. Similarly, after pressing
        windows + tab I was met with a page full of applications, and it likely
        have been faster to simply click the one I needed to open. However, some
        workflows were significantly more helpful, such as control +f and control
        tab. Overall, I think that it is useful to incorporate some keyboard shortcuts
        into my workflow, but I won't be abandoning my mouse just yet.  </li>
        <li> Remarkable projects
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/08/26/epic-and-time-studios-launch-martin-luther-king-jr-educational-experience-in-fortnite"> March Through Time: Presented by Time in Fortnite</a>
                  <br>
                This is a fascinating project that attempts to meet young audiences
                where they are, in this case, roaming the rpg/fps game that is
                fortnite. This collaboration allows players to listen go to an event
                in game that recounts the MKL Jr.'s historic I have a dream speech
                along with a museum and other elements. It is simply wild to see
                a video game create in person events meant to educate kids an
                important topic that is largely unrelated to itself. </li>
                <li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/1619-america-slavery.html">The 1619 Project</a>
                  <br>
                This initiative by the New York Times works to reframe the History
                of the United States around slavery and race. This project is important
                because it tells a perspective that is often left out of history books
                and consequently de-ephasized in the minds of young people.</li>
                <li><a href="https://archive.org/web/"> The Wayback Machine </a>
                  <br>
                  The Wayback Machine is a digital archive for billions of web
                  pages. It periodically saves the code of a website and time/date
                  stamps it, then adds it to the archive so people can see how that
                  website has changed over time. Its a fascinating projects that allows
                  people to actually see the progress that the internet has made
                  in terms of UX, UI, and accessibility. </li>
